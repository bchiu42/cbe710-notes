<h2>Fluctuations and thermodynamic response functions<a class="headerlink" href="#fluctuations-and-thermodynamic-response-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>In the last lecture, we introdued the Ising model as a simple model that
incorporates interactions between molecules. We showed that it is very
challenging to handle interactions analytically because we cannot
factorize the partition funtion, and instead used mean-field theory to
approximate the interaction between each spin and its neighbors as
equivalent to the average interaction between spins in the entire
system. Mean-field theory is a convenient approximation that can
simplify systems sufficiently to allow for analytical approximations.
However, by assuming that the local properties of each region of a
system can be approximated by the average properties of the entire
system, mean-field theory neglects the local fluctuations throughout a
system (or fluctuations in system properties as a function of time) that
can be important. Hence, we will close our study of statistical
mechanics by discussing the importance of fluctuations and how these can
be connected to macroscopic quantities, thus providing information
neglected by mean-field theory.</p>
<p>We begin by clarifying what is meant by <em>fluctuations</em> in this context.
Consider the energy, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_j\)</span>, of a system described by the canonical
ensemble (fixed <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(NVT\)</span>). The energy can vary between many different
equivalent microstates of the canonical ensemble with different values
of the energy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_j\)</span>, and we can define an ensemble average value of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\langle E \rangle = \sum_j p_j E_j\)</span>. We can think of fluctuations in
the energy in two different ways. First, we can imagine examining the
system as a function of time, and periodically recording the
instantaneous energy, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E(t)\)</span>. At each snapshot of the system,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E(t) = E_j\)</span>, in other words, the system by definition will be in some
microstate such that its energy at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> will have a value equal to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_j\)</span>. According to the ergodic hypothesis, over sufficiently long times
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\int E(t) dt = \langle E \rangle\)</span> - that is, all microstates will be
visited according to their Boltzmann-weighted probabilities and we can
observe the ensemble average value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span>. Fluctuations by this
definition then refer to the expected <em>temporal</em> variation in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E(t)\)</span> as
the system evolves in time. However, because ergodicity establishes the
equivalence of temporal measurements and ensemble averages, we can also
think of fluctuations in the energy as a measure of the variance in the
energy in the ensemble of microstates - i.e. simply a statistical
quantity which reflects the distribution of energies accessible to a
system. The key point here is that temporal fluctuations in the quantity
are exactly equal to the statistical fluctuations in that quantity over
long enough observation times such that ergodicity establishes the
equivalence of the temporal average and ensemble average.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../_images/fig_8_3.png" />{width=”100%”}</p>
<p>Having established the definition of fluctuations, why do we care? Let
us first consider fluctuations of the energy in the canonical ensemble.
Taking the <em>statistical</em> definition of fluctuations, we can write the
ensemble-average variance, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle\)</span>, in the
canonical ensemble as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle &amp;= \langle (E - \langle E \rangle )^2 \rangle \\
&amp;=  \langle E^2 -  2 E \langle E \rangle +  \langle E \rangle^2 \rangle \\
&amp;= \langle E^2 \rangle - 2 \langle E \rangle \langle E \rangle + \langle E \rangle ^2 \\
&amp;= \langle E^2 \rangle  - \langle E \rangle ^2
\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Here we have simply rewritten the ensemble-averaged square fluctuation
(i.e., the ensemble-averaged variance) in terms of ensemble averages of
the energy itself. We can now use equations from the canonical ensemble
to substitute for these terms.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle  = \langle E^2 \rangle  - \langle E \rangle ^2 &amp;= \sum_j p_j E_j ^2 - \left (\sum_j p_j E_j \right)^2 \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{Z}\sum_j E_j^2 e^{-\beta E_j} - \left (  \frac{1}{Z} \sum_j E_j e^{-\beta E_j}\right )^2
\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>We next recognize that from the definition of the partition function,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Z = \sum_j e^{-\beta E_j}\)</span>, we get
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\partial Z}{\partial \beta} = -\sum_j E_j e^{-\beta E_j}\)</span>.
Therefore the above expression becomes:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{Z} \left (  \frac{\partial^2 Z}{\partial \beta^2} \right )_{N, V} - \left ( \frac{1}{Z} \left (  \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \beta} \right )_{N, V} \right )^2 \\
&amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \left ( \frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \beta} \right )_{N, V} \\
&amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial \beta} \left ( \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta} \right )_{N, V}
\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Note the use of the product rule to simplify the first line to the
second line. We recall from Lecture 3 that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\langle E \rangle = -\left ( \frac{\partial \ln Z}{\partial \beta} \right )_{N, V}\)</span>
to get:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle &amp;= -\left ( \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial \beta} \right )_{N, V}  \\
&amp;= k_B \left ( \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial T} \right )_{N, V} \left ( \frac{\partial T}{\partial T^{-1}} \right )_{N, V}\\
&amp;= k_B T^2 \left ( \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial T} \right )_{N, V} \\
&amp;= k_BT ^2 C_V \label{heat_capacity}
\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In the last line, we recognize that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left ( \frac{\partial \langle E \rangle}{\partial T} \right )_{N, V}\)</span>
is the <strong>heat capacity at constant volume</strong>, an experimentally
measurable material constant. This relationship is remarkable - it shows
that the fluctuation (either with respect to time or with respect to the
variation in the statistical ensemble) of energy in a system at fixed
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(NVT\)</span> is related to the rate at which energy in that system changes due
to changes in the temperature. We call <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_V\)</span> a <em>thermodynamic response
function</em>; that is, it shows the response of a system (i.e. change in
energy) at equilibrium to a change in a parameter (i.e. the
temperature). The relation above shows that microscopic fluctuations in
the energy are a measure of the thermodynamic response of a system.</p>
<p>This relationship is strictly derived only at equilibrium, since
everything we have done so far in statistical mechanics is at
equilibrium; it turns out that similar relationships between statistical
fluctuations and the response of a system also occur in non-equilibrium
processes, leading to the so-called fluctuation-dissipation
relationship, but that is outside of the scope of this lecture.</p>
<p>The relationship between fluctuations and a thermodynamic response
illustrates a new means of calculating the heat capacity of the
material. Without knowledge of this relationship, the simplest way to
calculate the heat capacity would be to perform multiple experiments at
different temperatures, measure the corresponding system energy, and
equate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_V\)</span> to the slope of the resulting line. Instead, Eq.
<span class="xref myst">[heat_capacity]</span>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”heat_capacity”} shows that we could take a single system at a
fixed temperature and instead measure the fluctuations of the energy
over time to obtain <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_V\)</span> in a single experiment. Such measurements will
be possible using computer simulations as we will discuss in future
lectures. We could also derive the fluctuations of other quantities,
such as the density, and connect these to other materials parameters as
a general means of computing response functions from equilibrium
fluctuations.</p>

<section id="size-of-fluctuations-and-the-equivalence-of-ensembles">
<h2>Size of fluctuations and the equivalence of ensembles<a class="headerlink" href="#size-of-fluctuations-and-the-equivalence-of-ensembles" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The next question we will address how large fluctuations actually are
relative to the average energy of the system. If fluctuations are much
smaller than the average energy of the system, then the system energy
will appear approximately constant. To determine the relative size of
fluctuations, we recognize that the heat capacity, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C_V\)</span>, is extensive
and scales with the number of particles of the system, and thus is of
order <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> (this was explicitly shown for an ideal gas). The energy, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span>,
is also extensive and scales with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> (also shown for an ideal gas). The
ratio of fluctuations to the average energy is then:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\frac{\sqrt{\langle ( \delta E)^2 \rangle}}{\langle E \rangle} &amp;=  \frac{\sqrt{k_BT ^2 C_V}}{\langle E \rangle} \\
&amp;\approx \frac{\sqrt{N}}{N}\\
&amp;\approx N^{-1/2}
\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>This scaling analysis indicates that if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> is a large number (e.g. on
the order of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(10^{23}\)</span> particles), then the ratio of fluctuations to the
average energy approaches zero and the energy of the system is
effectively constant. Thus, in the large <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> limit the average energy
calculated from the canonical ensemble will be identical to the average
energy of a microcanonical ensemble because energy fluctuations are
negligible - and this is exactly the limit in which classical
thermodynamics is valid.</p>
<p>To illustrate this point in just a bit more detail, we can write the
equation for the canonical partition function by summing over all energy
levels, and including the explicit degeneracy of energy level <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\nu\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Z(N,V,T) = \sum_\nu \Omega(N,V,E_\nu) e^{-\beta E_\nu}\]</div>
<p>In the large <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> limit, we just showed that only a single value of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E_\nu\)</span>, the ensemble average value, is meaningful, as fluctuations away
from this value are unlikely. Thus, the degeneracy
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Omega(N,V,\langle E \rangle)\)</span> is significantly larger than any other
term in the summation, and we can write the partition function instead
as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[Z(N,V,T) = \Omega(N,V,\langle E \rangle) e^{-\beta\langle E \rangle}\]</div>
<p>Taking the logarithm of this expression and equating to the Helmholtz
free energy yields:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
F &amp;= -k_BT \ln Z(N,V,T) \\ 
&amp;= -k_B T \ln \left [ \Omega(N,V,\langle E \rangle) e^{-\beta\langle E \rangle} \right ] \\
&amp;= \langle E \rangle -k_B T \ln \Omega(N,V,\langle E \rangle)
\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>We can compare this last expression to the thermodynamic definition of
the Helmholtz free energy, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F = E - TS\)</span>. Therefore, we get that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S = k_B \ln \Omega(N,V,\langle E \rangle)\)</span>, the Boltzmann entropy used
to define the microcanonical ensemble, and we see that the two ensembles
make equivalent predictions for the Helmholtz free energy. Similar
measures of equivalency could be performed in the thermodynamic limit
for other ensembles as well.</p>
<p>There are thus four important conclusions to draw from our study of
fluctuations: 1) that in the thermodynamic limit, fluctuations are
negligible, and hence we can discuss single values of thermodynamic
variables as being equivalent to ensemble averages; 2) that in the
thermodynamic limit all ensembles are equivalent, and hence we can use
any ensemble that is mathematically convenient to relate molecular
properties to macroscopic observables; 3) that microscopic fluctuations
are proportional to a response function, both in equilibrium and in
non-equilibrium processes; and 4) fluctuations are measurable properties
of a system that can be used to inform experimental measurements (e.g.
in light scattering).</p>

transition into an alternative approach to calculating the statistical

<section id="introduction-two-main-simulation-methods">
<h2>Introduction: two main simulation methods<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-two-main-simulation-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>In the previous lecture, we performed a first analysis of a many-body,
interacting system; that is, a system in which particle interactions are
included in the potential energy function of the system. We also saw
that for even a very simple model, the two-dimensional Ising model,
analytically calculating system properties becomes immensely complex
when interactions are included. For most systems of interest, such as
condensed matter systems, analytical solutions are impossible.</p>
<p>How, then, can we leverage the strength of statistical mechanics - that
is, relating microscopic features of a system to macroscopic
thermodynamic properties via the partition function - if the partition
function cannot be analytically obtained? One solution is to simulate
the systems of interest to sample system configurations according to the
correct underlying probability distribution rooted in the findings from
statistical mechanics. These simulations, which we will refer to as
<strong>molecular simulations</strong> to distinguish from alternative simulation
methodologies that focus on computing quantum mechanical properties,
will be the focus of the next few lectures.</p>
<p>In this class, we will focus on two major types of simulation methods:
<strong>Monte Carlo simulations</strong>, abbreviated as MC simulations, and
<strong>Molecular Dynamics simulations</strong>, abbreviated as MD simulations. MC
and MD simulations aim to calculate the same properties of a system, but
the two methods differ in their approach. The two methods can be
compared by recalling the ergodic hypothesis, which states that the
time-average value of a system property <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Y\)</span> over a sufficiently long
timescale <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> is equivalent to the ensemble-average value of that
same property (from Lecture 2):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{\tau} \int_0^{\tau} Y(t) dt &amp;= \sum p_i Y_i 
    
\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>In MD simulations, we explicitly simulate the time-evolution of particle
positions using a modified version of Newton’s equations of motion in
which forces are calculated, used to compute particle velocities, and
then particle positions are determined by integrating the equation of
motion with a discrete, short time interval (i.e. the <em>simulation
timestep</em>). This approach effectively treats the computer simulation as
an experiment and extracts time-average simulation properties. Hence,
the MD approach models the left-hand side of the above equation. The
challenge with MD simulations is often ensuring that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> is
sufficiently long to sample states from the observed system; in other
words, ensuring that a system is both in equilibrium and ergodic is a
major challenge of MD. From a practical standpoint, the MD equations of
motion require the calculation of forces, which requires the potential
energy function of the system to be everywhere continuous and
differentiable.</p>
<p>In MC simulations, we take an approach consistent with the right-hand
side of the equation above and attempt to directly sample configurations
from the equilibrium ensemble, weighted according to their probability
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p_i\)</span>. MC simulations thus relate more directly to the tools of
statistical mechanics, specifically because the probability of a
particular configuration can be determined based on the corresponding
statistical ensemble (i.e., a Boltzmann weight is associated with each
state in the canonical ensemble). Sampling from an equilibrium ensemble
then requires calculating these probabilities, which in practice
requires an expression for the energy of each configuration. Unlike MD
simulations, there is no attempt made in conventional MC simulations to
explicitly represent time and there is no need to calculate forces, so
the underlying potential energy surface can be discontinuous if desired.
Similarly, there does not have to be a physical path between states
sampled as long as the energy is well-defined for each state. These
strengths of MC simulations are also weaknesses, however, as inherently
time-dependent properties (such as a diffusion coefficient) cannot be
accurately measured.</p>
<p>We will learn more details about each of these algorithms in the next
few lectures. First, however, we will discuss some initial topics
regarding how a physical system is actually modeled in a simulation
representation.</p>

<section id="model-description-of-a-simulation-system">
<h2>Model description of a simulation system<a class="headerlink" href="#model-description-of-a-simulation-system" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Regardless of whether we sample a simulation observable using a MC or MD
method, we first need to understand how to model a physical system. This
choice is system specific and depends on many factors, including the
length scale over which we expect interesting behavior, the importance
of thermal motions, etc. Here, we will summarize various ways to
represent a physical system and comment on examples in the literature
for which they are commonly used.</p>
<section id="particle-based-representations">
<h3>Particle-based representations<a class="headerlink" href="#particle-based-representations" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The most common simulation model consists of a set of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> particles,
where each particle represents either a single atom or some collection
of atoms. A single configuration of the system is then specified by by
the coordinates <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\textbf{r}^N\)</span> and momenta <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\textbf{p}^N\)</span> of all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>
particles. In this notation, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\textbf{r}^N\)</span> represents a
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3N\)</span>-dimensional vector of all particle coordinates in 3D; the bold font
indicates a vector. Particles are typically also associated with
chemical properties such as a set of masses, charges, and interaction
parameters.</p>
<p>There are three common ways of representing molecules in particle-based
simulations. In all-atom simulations, each atom is represented by a
particle. In united-atom simulations, all aliphatic carbon atoms and
their bonded hydrogen atoms are combined into a single particle, while
all remaining atoms are represented as individual particles. In
coarse-grained simulations, multiple atoms are combined into a single
particle, with the number of atoms corresponding to each particle
defined by as the extent of coarse-graining. While clearly representing
every atom in a system yields the most detailed information, the
trade-off is that including additional particles increases the
computational expense of the simulation. Hence, the goal of
coarse-graining is to remove explicit descriptions of particles that
contribute minimally to the behavior of the system (often solvent
molecules, for example) in favor of reducing the computational expense
of calculations, which in turn allows for longer simulations (e.g. a
longer observation time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> in a MD simulation, or more states
sampled in a MC simulation). Devising methods to accurately remove atoms
from a simulation while retaining the same behavior as at a more
detailed length scale is the primary challenge in coarse-graining.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../_images/fig_9_1.png" />{width=”100%”}</p>
<p>Example systems typically modeled at each level of resolution include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>All-atom - single solutes in solution (e.g. ions in water); small
proteins; nanomaterials</p></li>
<li><p>United-atom - lipids; self-assembled monolayers; surfactants</p></li>
<li><p>Coarse-grained - polymers; multicomponent cell membranes; liquid
crystals, macromolecular complexes</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="lattice-models">
<h3>Lattice models<a class="headerlink" href="#lattice-models" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Another means of representing a system is by projecting all coordinates
onto a discrete set of lattice points, as opposed to a continuous set of
coordinates; we solved lattice models analytically for the Langmuir
isotherm and the Ising model in the Statistical Mechanics unit. A
lattice model is an inherently (highly) coarse-grained system, and is
typically used for systems for which MD simulations are inappropriate
due to the difficulty in sampling a system ergodically. Due to the
discretization of lattice positions, lattice models are typically used
with MC sampling since forces may be not be easily obtained.</p>
<p>Beyond the MC simulations studied in this class, lattice models are
often used with field-based simulation techniques, such as
self-consistent field theory, or with techniques in which the system is
treated using equations from continuum mechanics (finite element
analysis) or fluid dynamics (Lattice Boltzmann methods). These
techniques are beyond the scope of this class. Examples of systems in
which lattice models may be used with MC simulations include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Protein folding (i.e. the HP model)</p></li>
<li><p>Phase behavior of polymer blends / mixtures</p></li>
<li><p>Phase behavior of lipid/protein mixtures</p></li>
<li><p>Hard condensed phase materials (i.e. vacancy diffusion)</p></li>

<section id="interactions-between-particles">
<h2>Interactions between particles<a class="headerlink" href="#interactions-between-particles" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Having defined various ways of representing a physical system and
modeling the positions of particles, we now can define how interactions
are defined in a molecular system. Interactions are defined in terms of
a potential energy function that is a function of particle coordinates
(along with other possible system parameters, such as the presence of an
external field).</p>
<p>First, we will consider potentials in typical atomistic or
coarse-grained, particle-based simulations, as these potentials are
common for both MC and MD simulations of distinct molecules.
Interactions can largely be divided into two classes: <strong>bonded</strong>
interactions, which include interactions meant to represent covalent
bonds, bond angles, and torsional angles; and <strong>non-bonded</strong>
interactions, which describe interactions between atoms/particles that
are not bonded together, and generally reflect common intermolecular
forces. In most such systems, non-bonded interactions are assumed to be
<em>pairwise</em>, meaning that they only involve pairs of particles, as
opposed to <em>many-body</em> interactions that could involve the interactions
between a set of particles. Below, we summarize several typical
potentials that would be used primarily in atomistic or coarse-grained
MD simulations that fall into each of these categories.</p>
<section id="bonded-potentials">
<h3>Bonded potentials<a class="headerlink" href="#bonded-potentials" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p><img alt="image" src="../_images/fig_9_3.png" />{width=”40%”}</p>
<p>Bonds in real systems emerge from quantum mechanics, and hence any
simulation representation that neglects electron degrees of freedom is
an approximation to a covalent bond. Most atomic simulations include
potentials to restrict bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles,
with the typical implementation of these potentials being a harmonic
spring. Since the specifics of this approach will vary significantly on
a case-by-case basis we will not discuss bonded potentials in more
detail other than recognizing their existence.</p>
</section>
<section id="non-bonded-potentials">
<h3>Non-bonded potentials<a class="headerlink" href="#non-bonded-potentials" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The most common non-bonded interaction in molecular simulations is the
Lennard-Jones potential, or the 12-6 potential, which is typically
written as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
    E_{\textrm{LJ}}(r_{ij}) &amp;= 4\epsilon_{ij} \left [ \left( \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\right )^{12} - \left( \frac{\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}}\right )^6 \right ] 
    
\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>Here, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_{ij}\)</span> is the (scalar) distance between particle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon_{ij}\)</span> is a characteristic interaction energy and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{ij}\)</span>
is a characteristic interaction length scale describing the approximate
diameter of a particle. The Lennard-Jones potential is broken into an
attractive interaction that scales with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r^{-6}\)</span> and a repulsive
potential that scales with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r^{-12}\)</span>. The attractive potential
represents three contributions to typical van der Waals interactions
that are all attractive and scale with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r^{-6}\)</span>: London dispersion
forces, which are related to interactions between instantaneous dipoles
that arise from quantum mechanical considerations; dipole-induced dipole
interactions, which are related to attractions between dipoles on a
molecule and induced dipoles that arise from the polarizibility of a
different molecule; and Keesom interactions, which emerge from the
orientation dependence of dipole-dipole interactions. In general, we do
not attempt to divide the LJ potential into contributions from these
three distinct interactions, but rather empirically identify parameters
for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> which capture all three effects. The
repulsive potential represents Pauli exclusion, which acts to ensure
that particle wave functions do not overlap. There is no single scaling
relation for Pauli exclusion other than that it must be a strong
repulsive force, so for computational convenience <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r^{-12}\)</span> is chosen
since the calculated <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r^{-6}\)</span> term can be simply squared.</p>
<p>In addition to van der Waals interactions, it is typical to associate
charges (or partial charges, to account for the unequal distribution of
electrons throughout a molecule that leads to dipoles) to atoms or
particles in a system. These charges interact via a long-range Coulombic
potential:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[E_{\textrm{coulomb}}(r_{ij}) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r}\frac{q_i q_j}{r_{ij}}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon_0\)</span> is the permittivity of free space, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon_r\)</span> is
the relative dielectric constant (1 in vacuum, 2-4 in oil, 80 in water),
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q_i\)</span> is the charge on particle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>. In practice, Coulombic
interactions are difficult to calculate in simulations due to periodic
boundary conditions because they decay slowly and the minimum image
convention is a severe underestimate of the total magnitude of
electrostatic interactions. Instead, advanced techniques, such as Ewald
summations, have been derived handle their calculation. Such methods are
outside of the scope of this discussion but are discussed in the Frenkel
and Smit textbook if you would like to review them on your own.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../_images/fig_9_4.png" />{width=”100%”}</p>
<p>Many other non-bonded interactions are possible and in common use, but
these represent the two most common functional forms used in most
atomistic simulations.</p>
</section>
<section id="interactions-in-mc-simulations">
<h3>Interactions in MC simulations<a class="headerlink" href="#interactions-in-mc-simulations" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The interactions described above are all described by potentials that
are continuous and differentiable, and thus can be used in molecular
dynamics simulations. However, Monte Carlo simulations can use any
potential energy function regardless of whether it is differentiable,
expanding the repertoire of possible interactions. Some examples of
interactions used in MC simulations are noted here. The first is a
hard-sphere interaction, where particles are strictly not allowed to
overlap (akin to an infinitely strong repulsive potential part of the
Lennard-Jones interaction):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}E_{\textrm{hard}}(r_{ij}) =  \left\{  \begin{array}{ccc}
    \infty &amp;,&amp; r_{ij} &lt; \sigma \\
    0&amp;,&amp; r_{ij} \geq \sigma
    \end{array} \right\}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Another example is the interaction between nearest-neighbors used in the
Ising model, which can be easily represented in MC simulations:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}E_{\textrm{Ising}}(r_{ij}) =  \left\{  \begin{array}{ccc}
    -J &amp;,&amp; \text{if $i,j$ are neighbors} \\
    0&amp;,&amp;\text{otherwise}
    \end{array} \right\}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In principle, many other possible interactions could be defined; here we
only included a subset that are commonly found in the simulation
literature and map directly to many experimental problems.</p>
