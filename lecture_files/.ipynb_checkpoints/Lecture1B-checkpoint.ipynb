    "on the former two subjects, although some principles from quantum\n",
    "mechanics will occasionally be referenced. We will first discuss each\n",

    "goals of this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thermodynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "[Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics)\n",
    "studies the *macroscopic* properties of systems at\n",
    "equilibrium. Classical thermodynamics does not require knowledge of the\n",
    "microscopic details of a system; for example, we might know that a box\n",
    "contains some amount of gas, but thermodynamic properties do not depend\n",
    "on knowledge of the precise positions of gas molecules.\n",
    "Thermodynamics provides a framework that relates macroscopic properties, and their\n",
    "changes, to one another.\n",
    "However, thermodynamic relations alone cannot predict the magnitude of these changes,\n",
    "which require knowledge on *material parameters* that must be empirically determined.\n",
    "Finally, thermodynamics is based on a set of postulates which are empirically known to hold but cannot be\n",
    "rigorously proven.\n",
    "Here is an example of a thermodynamic relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: cv_cp\n",
    "C_P - C_V = \\left [ P + \\left ( \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial V}  \\right)_T \\right ] \\left ( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}  \\right)_P\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation {eq}`cv_cp` relates the difference in the [heat capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity)\n",
    "at constant pressure ($C_P$) and the heat capacity at constant volume ($C_V$) to the pressure ($P$),\n",
    "partial derivative of the internal energy $E$ with respect to volume at constant\n",
    "temperature, and partial derivative of the volume with respect to temperature ($T$)\n",
    "at constant pressure. No microscopic information is\n",
    "provided and all quantities are expressed in terms of differential\n",
    "changes in system properties; the actual *values* of these partial\n",
    "derivatives and materials parameters must be measured experimentally (or\n",
    "predicted from knowledge of the molecular properties of a system).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "The weakness - and arguably, power - of thermodynamics is that it\n",
    "provides no molecular, microscopic description of the system of\n",
    "consideration, but rather provides universal equations relating\n",
    "measurable macroscopic properties. Statistical mechanics takes the\n",
    "opposite approach by *beginning* with a microscopic description of a\n",
    "system then deriving macroscopic properties.\n",
    "Using statistical mechanics, we seek to derive the\n",
    "macroscopic properties of systems at or near equilibrium from a\n",
    "statistical description of the enormous ($\\approx 10^{20}$) number of\n",
    "particles in a typical macroscopic system. Thermodynamics and\n",
    "statistical mechanics thus treat the same systems, but the exact,\n",
    "macroscopic relations provided by thermodynamics can now be complemented\n",
    "by system-specific quantities calculated from molecular details. In\n",
    "effect, statistical mechanics answers the question of why **specific**\n",
    "systems behave in the way that they do - that is, what accounts for the\n",
    "specific values of macroscopic quantities. This connection between\n",
    "thermodynamics and statistical mechanics will be highlighted throughout\n",
    "the course. Here are examples of equations that we will see frequently\n",
    "throughout this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: canonical_partition\n",
    "Z(N,V,T) = \\sum_i^{\\textrm{states}} \\exp\\left (-\\frac{E_i(N, V)}{k_B T}\\right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: thermo_connection\n",
    "F = - k_B T \\ln Z(N,V,T)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation {eq}`canonical_partition` is the **canonical [partition\n",
    "function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(statistical_mechanics))**,\n",
    "one of the key equations that we will discuss. In this\n",
    "equation, $E_i$ is the energy of a particular microstate - or a specific\n",
    "configuration of all particles - of the system and the summation\n",
    "accounts for **all possible microstates** of the system. The number of\n",
    "microstates can be enormously large. The partition function illustrates\n",
    "that statistical mechanics deals with particle-specific quantities\n",
    "(i.e., energies), but takes into account the incredibly large number of\n",
    "particles and possible particle positions that contribute to the\n",
    "macroscopic behavior of a system. Equation\n",
    "{eq}`thermo_connection` illustrates the connection between\n",
    "thermodynamics and statistical mechanics by writing the Helmholtz free\n",
    "energy - a macroscopic system parameter - as a function of the canonical\n",
    "partition function - a microscopic system parameter. This connection\n",
    "between thermodynamics and statistical quantities will be a major\n",
    "feature of our studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "While statistical mechanics provides a microscopic framework that\n",
    "thermodynamics does not, this framework still depends on parameters\n",
    "that describe the behavior and energetics of the atoms and molecules,\n",
    "such as particle-specific energy levels ($E_i$ in the\n",
    "partition function above). In principle, this information can be\n",
    "obtained from quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics defines the set of\n",
    "possible states for a specific particle,\n",
    "and relative energy levels of these states, for a\n",
    "single particle; however, it provides no information on the likelihood\n",
    "that a particle is found in any such state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider [an ideal particle confined within a one-dimensional box](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Physical_Chemistry_(LibreTexts)/03%3A_The_Schrodinger_Equation_and_a_Particle_in_a_Box) with length $L$ by\n",
    "two walls. We'll say that the potential energy of the particle is zero for any position within the box and infinite elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](figs/fig_1_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the box is sufficiently small, quantum mechanics gives an understanding\n",
    "of _where_ the particle could be found in this box, because not all positions\n",
    "or energies are equally likely. QM provides the following description of the energy\n",
    "levels accessible to a single particle that has a single\n",
    "translational degree of freedom within this box:\n"
