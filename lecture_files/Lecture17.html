<h2>Direction of heat transfer<a class="headerlink" href="#direction-of-heat-transfer" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>In the previous lecture, we introduced the four postulates that will
guide our study of thermodynamics, and furthermore discussed the first
law of thermodynamics as derived from Postulate 3. Having defined the
four postulates, we can now think about some of the consequences of
these definitions and examine situations in which postulates would be
violated. For this discussion, it’s helpful to remember the postulates
which we paraphrase here from Lecture 16:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Postulate 1: Thermodynamic systems are in stable equilibrium states
that can be completely characterized by two independently variable
properties and the masses of system components.</p></li>
<li><p>Postulate 2: In processes for which there is no net effect on the
environment, systems evolve toward a single stable equilibrium
state.</p></li>
<li><p>Postulate 3: Any two equilibrium states are connected by at least
one adiabatic process which uniquely determines the change in energy
between these two states.</p></li>
<li><p>Postulate 4: If the sets of systems <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> each have
no heat interaction when connected across diathermal walls, then
there will be no heat interaction if systems <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> are also so
connected.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let us first show that we can use Postulate 4 to understand the
directionality of heat transfer. Assume we have 3 systems, labeled
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A, B, C\)</span>, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> connected to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> connected to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> as defined
in the postulate. Based on Postulate 4, we define a quantity, the
temperature, which is a state function that is equal for two systems
that are connected by diathermal walls but do not undergo heat
interactions. We will assume that the temperature of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_A\)</span>, is
greater than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_B\)</span>, and heat interactions are defined such that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\underline{Q}_{A \rightarrow B} &gt; 0\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\underline{Q}_{B \rightarrow C} &gt; 0\)</span>. Since heat can flow from
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\rightarrow B\)</span> and from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\rightarrow C\)</span>, this also then implies that
there is a heat interaction between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span>. We will show that this
requires <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_C &lt; T_B\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_B\)</span> equals <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_C\)</span>, then we infer from Postulate 4 that there is no
heat interaction between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span>, which contradicts the system
description that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\underline{Q}_{B \rightarrow C} &gt; 0\)</span>. If we were to
allow the systems to interact such that
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\underline{Q}_{A \rightarrow B} = \underline{Q}_{B \rightarrow C}\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_B\)</span> is fixed, then there would be a heat interaction between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span>; but if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_C &gt; T_B\)</span> then it would be possible for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_A = T_C\)</span>, in
which case there would be no heat interaction between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> which
again contradicts the system description. Thus, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_C &lt; T_B &lt; T_A\)</span> is
established by the flow of heat in this system.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../_images/fig_16_3.png" />{width=”70%”}</p>
<p>We have now shown that heat transfers from a high temperature system to
a low temperature system. Moreover, we can state that an increase in
energy increases the temperature of the system - that is, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dU/dT &gt; 0\)</span>.
This result follows from Postulate 2. If we had a system where heat
transferred from a low-temperature system to a high-temperature system,
and a decrease in energy decreases the temperature of the system, then
heat flow would continue indefinitely and Postulate 2 could not be
satisfied. We therefore require that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dU/dT &gt; 0\)</span>, and will follow
similar logic below.</p>
</section>
<section id="generalized-first-law">
<h2>Generalized First Law<a class="headerlink" href="#generalized-first-law" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Before moving on, let us consider an application of the First Law of the
Thermodynamics to an open system that is able to exchange energy and
particles with the surroundings. First, we can recall the First Law for
a closed system:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\Delta \underline{U} &amp;= \delta \underline{Q} + \delta \underline{W} \\
d\underline{U} &amp;= d\underline{Q} + d\underline{W}
\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The second line is the differential form of the first law for a closed
system; note that we should be careful to distinguish between the
differential work and differential heat, both of which are dependent on
the exact process under study (for example, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\underline{Q} = 0\)</span> for any
adiabatic process), while <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\underline{U}\)</span> is dependent only on the two
states connected by the process of interest. Recall that the First Law
emerged from the definition of Postulate 3, where we defined the change
in energy between two states as the work done along an adiabatic path.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../_images/fig_16_4.png" />{width=”70%”}</p>
<p>Now let us consider an open system, such that some number of molecules
can traverse the walls of the system. The system is enclosed by a
surface that we will call the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>-surface, which is movable and
diathermal so that there can be work and heat interactions. Part of the
surface is also permeable. In a time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta t\)</span> we will assume that a
number of molecules <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta N_\textrm{in}\)</span> are pushed into the system by
an external piston, with an intensive energy of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_\textrm{in}\)</span>
associated with each molecule (i.e. due to internal energy modes, such
as translation or vibration). We will define the system as the region
bounded by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>-surface <strong>and</strong> the number of molecules
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta N_\textrm{in}\)</span> added during this time interval. The external
pressure that forces the material into the system is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_\textrm{in}\)</span> and
the intensive volume per molecule is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_\textrm{in}\)</span>, which together
means work equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_\textrm{in} V_\textrm{in} \delta N_\textrm{in}\)</span>
is done on the system to add the material to the volume bounded by the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>-surface. There can also be additional work and heat
interactions with the system during this time interval given by
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta \underline{W}_\sigma\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta \underline{Q}_\sigma\)</span>. Since
our definition of the system includes a simple open system and the added
material, the composite system is now closed and we can apply the First
Law:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\underline{U}_2 - (\underline{U}_1+U_\textrm{in}\delta N_\textrm{in}) &amp;= \delta \underline{Q}_\sigma + \delta \underline{W}_\sigma + P_\textrm{in} V_\textrm{in} \delta N_\textrm{in} \\
\Delta \underline{U} &amp;= \delta \underline{Q}_\sigma + \delta \underline{W}_\sigma +(U_\textrm{in} + P_\textrm{in} V_\textrm{in}) \delta N_\textrm{in} \\
\Delta \underline{U} &amp;= \delta \underline{Q}_\sigma + \delta \underline{W}_\sigma + H_\textrm{in} \delta N_\textrm{in}
\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Here, we define <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\underline{U}_2\)</span> as the energy of the gas within the
region bounded by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> surface at the end of the process,
including the new gas that has been pumped in. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\underline{U}_1\)</span> is the
energy of the gas enclosed within the region bounded by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span>
surface at the start of the process, while
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(U_\textrm{in}\delta N_\textrm{in}\)</span> is the energy of the incoming gas.
This expression leads to the definition of a new quantity, the
<strong>enthalpy</strong>, as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
H_\textrm{in} = U_\textrm{in} + P_\textrm{in} V_\textrm{in}
\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_\textrm{in}\)</span> is the intensive enthalpy associated with the gas being
pumped in. Note that the sign on
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_\textrm{in} V_\textrm{in} \delta N_\textrm{in}\)</span> is positive because
we are adding energy to the system. This expression then effectively
says that the First Law for an open system is adjusted to account for
the enthalpy change associated with the change in the components of the
system. We can generalize this result to multiple components that can
simultaneously enter and leave the system and write it in differential
form (we will not derive this, but it is straightforward to do so):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[d\underline{U} = d\underline{Q} + d\underline{W} + \sum_{\textrm{in}} H_\textrm{in} d N_\textrm{in} - \sum_{\textrm{out}} H_\textrm{out} d N_\textrm{out}\]</div>
<p>This is the generalized, differential form of the first law for a
multicomponent open system.</p>

<h2>Case studies of postulates<a class="headerlink" href="#case-studies-of-postulates" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Let us now consider a series of possible processes and, following
similar logic used to determine the directionality of heat transfer,
determine whether each process is possible according to the four
postulates. This approach will lead to a discussion of the Second Law of
Thermodynamics. In some cases, we will discuss the behavior of a <strong>heat
engine</strong>, or a closed device that undergoes heat interactions with one
or more systems and work interactions with a work reservoir (that is
part of the environment) but is always returned to the same state as it
was prior to the interactions - that is, it only performs <strong>cyclic</strong>
processes. A work reservoir operates adiabatically and quasi-statically
and is used for storing energy. In each of these cases, we assume that
there are two systems, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, with corresponding temperatures
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_A &gt; T_B\)</span>. Finally, recall that we inferred that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(dU/dT &gt; 0\)</span> due to
the postulates - that is, increasing the energy of a system (via a heat
transfer, for example) necessarily increases its temperature and vice
versa. Now let us consider six cases and determine if they are possible
or not according to the postulates:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../_images/fig_17_1.png" />{width=”100%”}</p>
<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Heat transfers from system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> to system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>. This behavior
does not appear to violate any of the postulates since over sufficient
time the temperature of system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> will decrease, the temperature of
system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> will increase, and eventually an equilibrium will be reached
at which <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_A = T_B\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Heat transfers from system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> to system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. This behavior
violates Postulate 2, namely that there is an equilibrium state reached
in the long-time limit - in this case, there is no convergence to a
final state since the temperature would continue to change for both
systems as the temperature of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> decreases and the temperature of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>
increases.</p>
<p><strong>Case 3:</strong> Work is done on a heat engine by the work reservoir, and the
heat engine then transfers heat into system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. This behavior does not
appear to violate any postulates, regardless of whether heat transfers
between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> (the direction was chosen somewhat arbitrarily).
Because the work reservoir is part of the environment, transferring
energy from the work reservoir to either system via the reservoir does
not violate Postulate 2 since there is a net effect on the environment.
We conclude that work can be done <strong>on</strong> an engine by the environment
and completely transferred as heat into a system</p>
<p><strong>Case 4:</strong> Heat is transferred from system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> to the heat engine and
all of this energy appears as work in the reservoir, decreasing the
temperature of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>. This process violates Postulate 2. If this process
can occur, then the work produced by transferring heat from system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>
to the work reservoir could be injected back into the heat engine via
the process described in Case 3, indirectly leading to a heat transfer
into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. The two combined processes thus lead to a heat transfer from
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> according to the First Law - but this is exactly the same as
the process in Case 2, and hence violates Postulate 2. By extension,
<strong>any</strong> cyclic process that transfers energy from a system and converts
all of the transferred energy to usable work in the environment is
impossible. Such a process would lead to perpetual motion machines, for
example.</p>
<p><strong>Case 5:</strong> Heat is transferred from system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> to the heat engine. Some
of this heat is transferred to system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and some is transferred as
work to the work reservoir. Nothing in this process violates the
postulates, as over sufficiently long amounts of time the heat transfer
between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> will lead to a stable state.</p>
<p><strong>Case 6:</strong> All arrows from Case 5 are reversed - heat flows from system
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> to the heat engine then to system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, and work is transferred to
the heat engine from the work reservoir. Because work is being extracted
from the environment, this process is possible - the injected work makes
up for the transfer of heat, preserving Postulate 2.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="../_images/fig_17_2.png" />{width=”100%”}</p>
<p>The last two cases, Case 5 and 6, are opposites and both centrally
involve the heat engine as a means of controlling the conversion between
heat in the two systems and work in the environment. In principle, there
could be some processes associated with these state that violate the
postulates - for example, we could combine Cases 5 and 6 by transferring
heat <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta Q\)</span> from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> to the engine, transferring a small amount of
heat <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta q\)</span> from the engine to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>, and extracting the rest of the
heat from the engine to the environment. We then define a process in
which a small amount of work is transferred from the environment to the
engine, a large heat transfer <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta Q\)</span> is conducted from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> to the
heat engine, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta Q\)</span> is transferred from the engine back to
system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. System <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> has now undergone a cyclic process in which the
net result is the injection of usable work into the environment - this
is exactly Case 4, which is impossible. So there must be some limits
placed on the engine which mediates the heat and work interactions,
which we will now discuss.</p>
</section>
<section id="heat-engine-efficiency">
<h2>Heat engine efficiency<a class="headerlink" href="#heat-engine-efficiency" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Focusing on the heat engine in Case 5, the action of this engine
transfers heat from system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and does work on the environment. We can
define an <em>efficiency</em>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta\)</span>, for this engine as:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{aligned}
\eta_5 \equiv \eta_6 \equiv \eta \equiv -\frac{\delta W_E}{\delta Q_A}
\end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_5\)</span> is the efficiency of a heat engine performing Case 5,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_6\)</span> is the efficiency of a heat engine performing Case 6,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta W_E\)</span> is the work performed by the engine during the process and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta Q_A\)</span> is the heat extracted from the hot system, or in this case
system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. Reversing the signs of both of these values would be
equivalent to Case 6 and the efficiency would be unchanged. Following
the example of Case 5 and treating the engine as the system, work is
done <em>by</em> the heat engine so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta W_E &lt; 0\)</span>, and heat flows to the
engine away from system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta Q_A &gt; 0\)</span>. Thus, for all allowable
processes the efficiency is positive; switching the direction of these
processes would be impossible. Higher efficiencies indicates that a
higher fraction of the heat transferred from system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is converted
into work on the surroundings (versus being transferred to system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>)</p>
<p>From the discussion above, we know that the efficiency for Case 5 cannot
equal 1, since that would mean that all of the heat extracted from
system <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is usable as work in the environment. We also saw above that
it is possible to combine Case 5 and Case 6 in such a way as to violate
Postulate 2. To determine the required relationship between the
efficiencies of these two processes, we can imagine performing the
process in Case 5 to extract heat from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> while transferring some
energy to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and doing work on the environment, then performing the
process in Case 6 to extract work from the environment while
transferring energy from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> and transferring heat back into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>. If we
run these processes such that no net work is done on the environment
(<em>i.e.</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta W_E\)</span> is the same for the engine performing Case 5 and
Case 6), then the combined process is possible and does not violate the
postulates if:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\left [\delta Q_A \right]_{\textrm{Case 5}} &amp;\ge \left [\delta Q_A \right]_{\textrm{Case 6}} \\
\therefore \eta_5 &amp;\le \eta_6 &lt; 1
\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Recall that in Case 5 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta Q_A\)</span> is transferred to the engine (away
from the hot system) and in Case 6 <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta Q_A\)</span> is transferred from the
engine (to the hot system). If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_5 &gt; \eta_6\)</span> and there is no work
done on the environment, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_A\)</span> for the process in Case 5 is smaller
than <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q_A\)</span> for the process in Case 6, meaning that less energy is
extracted from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> during the process in Case 5 than is returned to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>
during the process in Case 6. Running these two processes cylically
would thus result in a net transfer of heat from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> since there
is no net effect on the environment. This transfer is impossible since
it reduces to Case 2.</p>
<p>If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_5 = \eta_6\)</span>, then the system and its environment both return to
their initial states. The latter case is referred to as a <strong>reversible
cycle</strong> as the action of both processes leaves no net effect on the
system or environment. Reversible cycles can only occur if there is no
loss heat due to friction or other processes not considered explicitly
in the two Cases; we will assume that any heat engine capable of
performing reversible cycles is immune from these factors and will refer
to it as a <strong>reversible heat engine</strong>. From the discussion above, we
then note that for any reversible heat engine <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_5 = \eta_6\)</span>, for any
other heat engine <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_5 &lt; \eta_6\)</span>, for any heat engine <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_5 &lt; 1\)</span>,
and thus we establish that in general <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_5 \le \eta_6 &lt; 1\)</span> (although
in principle <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_6 = 1\)</span> is possible for an irreversible engine,
although we will focus henceforth on reversible engines so this
possibility will be ignored). Finally, we note that a reversible heat
engine is the engine capable of extracting the most work from the
process performed in Case 5 during a cyclic process. If we were to
perform Case 5 and then Case 6 using a non-reversible heat engine such
that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta Q_A\)</span> were the same in each case, then less work must be
extracted during Case 5 than is returned to the system during Case 6
since <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_5 &lt; \eta_6\)</span> and these work terms can only be equal if
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_5 = \eta_6\)</span> and the engine is reversible. Therefore, a reversible
heat engine is of particular interest since it maximizes the work
extracted during cyclic processes (which will be relevant to the
generation of power, for example, when considering the theoretical
efficiency of power plants).</p>
<p>We have just defined a reversible heat engine as one that can perform
the processes in both Case 5 and Case 6 with the same efficiency,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\eta_5 = \eta_6 \equiv \eta\)</span>. In general, a process is reversible if a
second process could be performed to restore the system and all elements
of the surroundings to the initial state, except for differential
changes of second order. It also follows that all reversible processes
are necessarily quasi-static (i.e., they pass through a series of
equilibrium states), although not all quasi-static processes are
necessarily reversible. This observation stems from Postulate 2 - if a
process were not quasi-static, by definition it passes through isolated
non-equilibrium states that then must relax to equilibrium over
sufficiently long times according to Postulate 2. An isolated system
will not spontaneously revert back to the isolated non-equilibrium
state, and the only way to convert it back to its prior state would be
to remove the system from isolation. Thus, the transformation of the
non-equilibrium state to the equilibrium state is irreversible, and as a
result a completely reversible process cannot pass through
non-equilibrium states. To phrase it one more way - <em>all reversible
processes only pass through equilibrium states along a quasi-static
path</em>.</p>
